I'm an Indie Game Developer 5+ experiences that is looking for transitioning from game development to backend and tooling developer roles, focusing on languages such as Go, Python, React, or/and TypeScript.

I noticed an interest in helping developers while automating some processes to speed up development, documenting solutions at work, or just thinking about a good solution.

With my learning and real-world experience, I want to build good systems that can help developers to concentrate in their goals and let tools to handle recurring problems.

This is my professional path I want to follow as I achieve my personal goals, which is related to everything I have learned so far.
