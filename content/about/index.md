# About Me

I'm Indie Game Developer 5+ experiences that is looking to transition from game development to tool developer role.
For a long time I've been wondering for a long time what I'd like to do as a professional and now I'm looking for new experiences with a focus in developer experience and tools as I liked to automate and create a few scripts beside helping the team with documentation in how I implement a feature, find a solution and also guide in how to use a tool for example.
I'm studying more about programming for CLI Tools, Automation and Plugins focusing in help developers to code faster, debug better and have a good quality code.
To end, I'm focusing a little more about Data Structure and Algorithms to develop better solutions when creating tools.

### My Skills
- **Languages**: C#, Python, Go, TypeScript
