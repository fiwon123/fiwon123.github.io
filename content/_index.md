# About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an Indie Game Developer 5+ experiences that is looking for transitioning from game development to backend and tool developer roles, focusing on languages such as Go, Python, React, or/and TypeScript.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my learning and real-world experience, I want to build good systems that can help developers to concentrate in their goals and let tools to handle recurring problems.
